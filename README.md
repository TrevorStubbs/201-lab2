# Lab02: - About Me, with a guessing game
## Lab requirements
1. User would like to learn about me so they can know me better
  - Create an 'About Me' guessing game
  - In the html include a short bio: 
    - my education -
    - my job experience -
    - my goals -
  - `prompt()` the user of *exactly* **five** yes or no questions.
    - yes/no and y/n must be acceptable answers.
  - add `console.log()` messages to notify the user if they are correct.
    - when finished comment out the `console.log()`s and replace them with `alerts()`.
1. The user would like a personalized welcome message
  - Ask the user's name though a `prompt()` -
  - Display the name back to the user through a greeting welcoming them to the site -
  - Display the name back to them in the final message to the user.

  ## Style Guide
  1. JS must contain `use strict` and must be linked to the html file as an external script file
  1. Write clean code with proper indentation. 
    - There must not be any linter violations
  1. ACP regularly with good commit messages

  ## Stretch Goals
  - Push the CSS work. 

  ## Submission Requirements
  1. Submit the link to the repo.
  1. Add a comment to the submission with answers to:
    - How did this go, overall?
    - What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?
    - How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment
        - I think 1.5 hours. Plan to be done by 3pm

# Lab03:
## Requirements:

1. Create a top 10 in an `<ol>` -
1. Take all the code out of the functions -
1. Add a 6th question: -
    - Guess a number -
    - TODO Respond with too high or too low
    - limit the guesses to 4 tries -
    - If not correct tell the user the answer -
1. Add a 7th question:
    - A question with multiple correct answers
    - Give the user 6 attempts to a correct answer
    - Display all the possible answers to the user
    - Array
1. Setup a final score for the user. 

- Continue to use console.logs
- No functions or helper methods

### Stretch Goals
- Attempt to make the code more DRY by putting all the questions and answers and responses of the first 5 y/n questions into arrays.
- Modify the logic such that a 'for' loop will control the flow from question to question
- make the number guessing game use a random number.

### Submission Requirements
- Submit github link
- add to the comments
    - How did this go?
    - What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned?
    - How long did it take you to complete this assignment? How long did you think it was going to take

30min to make the `<ol>`-
1 hour to refactor into non functions-
30 min to make the guessing game-
1 hour to make the 7th question
30min for final score.

3.5 Should be done by 4pm.
I am finished at 3.15
